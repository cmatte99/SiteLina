        My musical journey initiated at a church, where I began playing the piano for hymns and gospel melodies. Over time, I transitioned into composing my own songs, infusing personal reflections into each piece.

        As my interest expanded, I explored diverse musical styles from various cultures. This exploration led to a fusion of rhythms and harmonies, transforming the piano into a medium for cross-cultural expression.

        Presently, my repertoire encompasses a range of genres, from the soulful tones of jazz to the intricate structures of classical compositions. Originating in a church setting, the piano has evolved into a universal language, facilitating the amalgamation of cultural influences. This journey underscores the piano's enduring role as a consistent companion in my musical endeavors.
